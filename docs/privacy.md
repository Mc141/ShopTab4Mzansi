# Privacy Policy for #ShopTab4Mzansi

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-23

## Summary

This extension collects no data and processes everything locally inside your browser.

## Overview

#ShopTab4Mzansi is a browser extension that adds a convenient Shopping button to Google Search pages for South African users. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection

**We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data or personally identifiable information (PII).**

This extension:
- Works entirely on your device (client-side)
- Does NOT send data to any server
- Does NOT use analytics or tracking
- Does NOT store your search queries
- Does NOT access your browsing history beyond Google Search pages
- Does NOT require an account or login
- Does NOT access or read cookies
- Does NOT modify or intercept network traffic
- Does NOT execute remote code

## Permissions

The extension requires minimal permissions:

- **Content scripts**: Limited to `google.com` and `google.co.za` domains only

No other permissions are required or used. The extension does not request or use any permissions beyond what is necessary for content scripts to function on the specified Google domains.

## What the Extension Does

1. Detects when you visit Google Search pages
2. Reads the search query from the URL (only on Google Search pages)
3. Adds a "Shopping" button to the page
4. Navigates to Shopping-style results when you click the button

All of this happens locally in your browser. No data leaves your device.

## Third-Party Services

The extension navigates to Google's own search results using an alternative display mode. When you click the Shopping button, you're taken to Google's Shopping-style results page.

This uses Google's own search functionality. Any data collection by Google on that page is subject to Google's privacy policy, not ours.

## Updates

If this privacy policy changes, we will update this document and notify users through the extension update mechanism.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any data, there's no data to access, modify, or delete. You have complete control. You can uninstall the extension at any time, and no trace of it will remain.
